Instead of dealing with "()" and complexity involved in it, let's go
with using a third-party library called "exp4j" (available for
download at: https://lallafa.objecthunter.net/exp4j/index.html). This
looks to be promising. Here are the steps to proceed:

1. Download the latest jar named - exp4j-0.4.8.jar from the above
site. It is just 46KB.

2. You will also need to keep the LICENSE copy of that third-party jar
in our distribution.

3. The Test.java code will now look like:

==================
import net.objecthunter.exp4j.Expression;
import net.objecthunter.exp4j.ExpressionBuilder;

public class Test {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        String exp = "(2+4)+(p^2+(3-1))";
        Expression ex = new ExpressionBuilder(exp).variable("p").build();
        double result = ex.setVariable("p", 3.14).evaluate();
        System.out.println("result = " + result);
    }

}
